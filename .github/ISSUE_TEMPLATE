8. The account information should be up to date and reflect the most recent data available from the service.
9. The user interface should be user-friendly, providing a seamless experience for viewing account details.




-Update an account in the service
Acceptance Criteria:

1. When I log in to the application and access my account settings or profile page, there should be an option to initiate the "Update Account" action.

2. After initiating the "Update Account" action, I should be presented with a user-friendly form or interface to edit my account information.

3. The form should allow me to update various account details, such as my name, contact information, profile picture, and any other relevant information.

4. Any mandatory fields should be clearly indicated, and the form should validate the data to ensure it meets the required format and criteria.

5. I should be able to review and confirm the changes before saving them. The form should also provide a "Cancel" option to discard any changes made.

6. Upon saving the updated information, the application should send a request to the service to update my account data.

7. The application should display a confirmation message indicating that my account information has been successfully updated.

8. Any updated information should be immediately reflected in my account profile.

9. If there are issues during the update process, such as network errors or data validation failures, the application should provide clear error messages to guide me in resolving the problem.

10. The "Update Account" action should be secure, requiring proper user authentication, and should only allow authorized users to update their own accounts.

11. The user interface should be designed with a user-centric approach, making the "Update Account" action easily accessible and intuitive for users.

-Delete an account from the service
Acceptance Criteria:

When I log in to the application, I should have access to a "Delete Account" feature, typically found in the account settings or profile page.
Upon selecting "Delete Account," the application should present a confirmation dialog or form to ensure that I genuinely want to delete my account. This dialog should clearly state the consequences of deletion, such as data loss and the inability to recover the account.
The confirmation dialog or form should include a field where I need to provide my password or some form of authentication to prevent unauthorized account deletions.
Once I confirm my intention and successfully authenticate, the application should initiate the account deletion process.
During the deletion process, the application should remove my personal information, associated data, and any account-related records from the service's databases.
After the account is deleted, I should no longer have access to my account and any features or content associated with it.
The application should display a confirmation message indicating that my account has been successfully deleted.
In case of any issues during the deletion process, such as authentication failure or system errors, the application should provide clear error messages or guidance on how to resolve the problem.
The deletion process should be irreversible to ensure data privacy and security.
The user interface should make the "Delete Account" feature readily accessible but not prone to accidental deletion, considering the sensitivity of this action.


-List all accounts in the service
Acceptance Criteria:

In the administrative dashboard or user management section of the application, there should be an option to initiate the "List All Accounts" action.
Upon selecting "List All Accounts," the application should retrieve a comprehensive list of all user accounts registered in the service.
The list of accounts should include essential user details, such as usernames, email addresses, account creation dates, and any other relevant information.
The list should be presented in a user-friendly and easy-to-navigate format, such as a table or list view, allowing administrators to sort, filter, or search for specific accounts.
The information should be up to date, reflecting the most recent data available in the service's database.
The application should provide options for administrators to perform common actions on user accounts, such as deactivating accounts, resetting passwords, or managing roles and permissions.
The "List All Accounts" action should be available exclusively to authorized administrators with the necessary privileges.
In case of any issues or errors when retrieving the account list, the application should display clear error messages to assist administrators in resolving the problem.
The user interface for listing accounts should be designed with the needs of administrators in mind, ensuring that it is efficient and user-friendly.

-Containerize your microservice using Docker
Acceptance Criteria:

In the microservice code repository, there should be a Dockerfile that defines the containerization process for the microservice.

The Dockerfile should specify a base image suitable for the microservice's technology stack (e.g., a specific Linux distribution or a language-specific image).

The Dockerfile should include all necessary instructions to install dependencies, compile the microservice code, and set up the runtime environment.

The microservice code and any configuration files should be copied into the Docker image, ensuring that the image contains everything required for the microservice to run.

The Docker image should expose the necessary ports or network interfaces to allow external services or clients to communicate with the microservice.

The Docker image should define environment variables for configuration parameters that can be provided at runtime, such as database connection settings or API keys.

The Docker image should specify the command or entry point that runs the microservice when the container starts.

The microservice should be containerized in a way that follows best practices for Docker image size optimization, security, and efficiency.

The Docker image should be versioned and tagged appropriately, ensuring that it's easy to identify and reference different versions of the microservice.

A Docker Compose file or Kubernetes deployment configuration (if applicable) should be provided to facilitate the orchestration and deployment of the containerized microservice.

The containerized microservice should be tested locally within a Docker environment to ensure it functions as expected.

Documentation should be updated to include instructions for building and running the Docker container, including any required environment variables or runtime configurations.

The Docker image should be stored in a container registry, such as Docker Hub or a private registry, to allow for distribution and deployment.


-Deploy your Docker image to Kubernetes
Acceptance Criteria:

The Docker image of our microservice should be versioned and available in a container registry, such as Docker Hub or a private registry.

The Kubernetes cluster should be accessible, properly configured, and have the necessary tools, such as kubectl, installed and set up for deployment.

In the Kubernetes cluster, there should be a defined namespace or environment where the microservice will be deployed. This should be specified in a Kubernetes manifest file.

The Kubernetes manifest file should be available and should define the deployment, service, and any necessary configurations for our microservice.

The Kubernetes manifest should use the correct Docker image and tag from the container registry, ensuring that it deploys the desired version of the microservice.

The Kubernetes deployment should include the appropriate resource requests and limits, ensuring that the microservice operates efficiently without consuming excessive resources.

The service configuration should expose the microservice through the appropriate network interface (e.g., a LoadBalancer or NodePort) and should include any required port mappings.

The deployment should define liveness and readiness probes to ensure that the microservice is healthy and responsive.

Any environment-specific or configuration-specific settings should be parameterized using Kubernetes ConfigMaps or Secrets.

The deployment should be tested in a staging or non-production environment to verify that the microservice is running correctly in the Kubernetes cluster.

Appropriate monitoring and logging solutions should be set up to monitor the microservice's behavior in the Kubernetes environment.

Documentation should be updated to include instructions for deploying the microservice to Kubernetes, including any specific commands, configurations, or dependencies.

The deployment process should be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, automating the deployment and ensuring that it can be easily repeated for future releases.
